Fit an affine transformation to given points.

From Jarno Elonen, http://elonen.iki.fi/code/misc-notes/affine-fit/

Description from webpage:

"The following Python function finds, by least squares fitting, an affine transformation that (approximately) transforms given set of points/vertices/vectors (from_pts) to another (to_pts). It works with arbitrary dimensional points and requires at least dim points, when your points are dim-dimensional."
